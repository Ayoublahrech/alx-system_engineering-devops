E-commerce Platform Slowdown Postmortem (2024-06-06)
This document details the postmortem analysis of the e-commerce platform slowdown that occurred on June 6, 2024.

Summary
The platform experienced slowdowns between 10:00 AM PST and 1:00 PM PST, impacting roughly 70% of users. The slowdown manifested in increased page load times and shopping cart abandonment. The root cause was identified as database connection pool exhaustion due to a recent database configuration change.

Timeline
10:15 AM PST: Monitoring alerts surfaced slow response times for product pages and checkout functionalities.
10:20 AM PST: Investigation revealed high database connection wait times.
10:30 AM PST: Assuming a database overload, the engineering team horizontally scaled the database instances.
11:00 AM PST: Horizontal scaling failed to resolve the issue. Further investigation led to the discovery of a maxed-out database connection pool.
11:30 AM PST: The incident was escalated. The database administration team identified a recent configuration change that unintentionally lowered the connection pool size.
12:30 PM PST: The database connection pool size was reverted to the previous value.
1:00 PM PST: Monitoring confirmed recovery of normal database connection wait times and platform performance.
Root Cause & Resolution
The slowdown stemmed from database connection pool exhaustion. A recent database configuration change inadvertently reduced the maximum allowed connections in the pool. This bottlenecked the application as it attempted to establish new connections exceeding the pool limit. Reverting the configuration change to the prior connection pool size resolved the issue.

Corrective & Preventative Measures
Strengthen Code Review: The code review process for database configuration changes will be bolstered to include checks for potential impact on connection pooling.
Automated Testing: We will implement automated tests to verify the health of the database connection pool after any configuration changes.
Monitoring & Alerting: We will review and potentially enhance existing monitoring systems to identify situations where the connection pool is nearing capacity.
Standardization: Database configuration changes will follow a standardized procedure to minimize errors.
This postmortem serves as a valuable learning experience for the engineering team. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined above, we aim to significantly reduce the likelihood of similar incidents in the future.
